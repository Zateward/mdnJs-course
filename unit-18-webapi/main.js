/* WHAT THE HELL ARE API'S */

// Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are constructs made available in programming languages to allow 
// developers to create complex functionality more easily. They abstract more complex code away from you, 
// providing some easier syntax to use in its place.

// There are 2 categories of APIs in JS:

// Browser APIs: These are built into your web browser, are able to expose data from the web browser and surrouding
// computer environment and do useful complex things with it. Thay are programmed in low level languajes like C++ or Rust.

// Third-party APIs: They are built in Java Script by objects, and functions facilitating the use of Java Script.
